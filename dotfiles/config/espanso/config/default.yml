# --- Injection Backend

# Espanso supports multiple ways of injecting text into applications. Each of
# them has its quirks, therefore you may want to change it if you are having problems.
# By default, espanso uses the "Auto" backend which should work well in most cases,
# but you may want to try the "Clipboard" or "Inject" backend in case of issues.
# backend: Clipboard

# --- Auto-restart

# Enable/disable the config auto-reload after a file change is detected.
auto_restart: true

# --- Clipboard threshold

# Because injecting long texts char-by-char is a slow operation, espanso automatically
# uses the clipboard if the text is longer than 'clipboard_threshold' characters.
# clipboard_threshold: 100
